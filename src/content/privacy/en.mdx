## 1. What Data Do We NOT Collect?

We believe it's important to start with what we **do not** collect, store, or transmit. We do **NOT** handle any of your personal data. Specifically:

- We do not track your browsing history across different websites.
- We do not collect your search queries.
- We do not collect any data you enter into forms on websites.
- We do not collect your email, name, or other contact information.

## 2. What Data DO We Collect and Why?

We collect a limited amount of anonymous data for two purposes: to ensure the extension's functionality and to improve it.

### a) Data for Extension Functionality (Stored Locally)

- **Cached Data:** To work faster, the extension temporarily stores website configuration data (e.g., from Wildberries) in your browser's session storage (`chrome.storage.session`). This data is automatically deleted when you close the browser.
- **Parsed Product Data:** The product data you collect using the parser is also temporarily stored in session storage to be displayed in the extension's window. This data is only available to you and is deleted when you close the browser.

### b) Anonymous Analytics Data

To understand how Market Ninja is used and how to make it better, we use Google Analytics. We only send anonymous information to this service, which cannot be used to identify you personally. You can review Google's Privacy Policy here: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

The following data is sent to Google Analytics:

- **Visited Page URL (`page_location`):** We collect the URL of the page where you activate the extension. This helps us confirm that the extension is working on the correct pages of supported websites.
- **Anonymous Events:** We track events like "parsing started," "file exported," or "an error occurred." This helps us understand which features are popular and where problems arise.
- **Anonymous Client Identifier (`client_id`):** A random string generated on first install that allows us to count the total number of users without identifying anyone personally.
- **Technical Information:** The extension's version, the browser's UI language, and the operating system type.

## 3. How Do We Use the Collected Data?

- To analyze and improve the functionality and stability of the extension.
- To understand which features are most valued by our users.
- To make informed decisions about developing new features.

**We never sell or share your data with third parties, with the sole exception of the anonymous data sent to Google Analytics for the purposes described above.**

## 4. Permissions We Require

The extension asks for the following permissions, and here is why:

- **`storage`:** Required to save your settings and cache data locally in your browser.
- **`tabs`:** Required to get the URL of the current tab to activate the parser on supported websites.
- **`scripting`:** Required to interact with the page to retrieve publicly available product data.
- **`downloads`:** Required to save the files (CSV, XLSX, JSON) that you export.
- **Host Permissions (for `lamoda.ru`, `wildberries.ru`, `ozon.ru`):** Required for the extension to work on these specific websites. We do not request broad access to all websites.

## 5. Your Rights

You can uninstall the extension at any time through your browser's settings, which will permanently delete all data associated with it from your computer.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes through the extension's description in the Chrome Web Store or via in-extension notifications.
